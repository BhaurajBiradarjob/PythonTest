# import arithmetic as calculator
# print(calculator.a)
# calculator.add(4,6)
# calculator.mul(5,2)

# using from keyword we can import, the main advantage of the from keyword is we can
# access members directly without using module names.

# from arithmetic import a, add
# print(a)
# add(4,6)

# Using *
# from arithmetic import *
# print(a)
# add(5,2)
# mul(5,2)

# from arithmetic import a as x , add as sum
# print(x)
# sum(4,6)
